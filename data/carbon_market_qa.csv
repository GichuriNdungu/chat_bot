Question,Answer
market mechanisms overview[edit],"the economic problem with climate change is that the emitters of greenhouse gases (ghgs) do not face the full cost implications of their actions.[8] these other costs are called external costs.[9] external costs may affect the welfare of others. in the case of climate change, ghg emissions affect the welfare of people now and in the future, as well as affecting the natural environment.[10] the social cost of carbon depends on the future development of emissions. this can be addressed with the dynamic price model of emissions trading."
economics[edit],"for the purposes of analysis, it is possible to separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness).[19] economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal social costs of their actions).[20] regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions.[21] there is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share the costs and benefits of reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming)."
market trends[edit],carbon emissions trading increased rapidly in 2021 with the start of the chinese national carbon trading scheme.[39] the increasing costs of permits on the eu ets have had the effect of increasing costs of coal power.[40]
business reaction[edit],"the international air transport association, whose 230 member airlines comprise 93% of all international traffic, position is that trading should be based on ""benchmarking"", setting emissions levels based on industry averages, rather than ""grandfathering"", which would use individual companies' previous emissions levels to set their future permit allowances. they argue grandfathering ""would penalise airlines that took early action to modernise their fleets, while a benchmarking approach, if designed properly, would reward more efficient operations"".[42]"
criticisms[edit],"emissions trading has been criticized for a variety of reasons. for example, in the popular science magazine new scientist, lohmann (2006) argued that trading pollution allowances should be avoided as a climate stabilization policy for several reasons. first, climate change requires more radical changes than previous pollution trading schemes such as the us so2 market. it requires reorganizing society and technology to ""leave most remaining fossil fuels safely underground"". carbon trading schemes have tended to reward the heaviest polluters with 'windfall profits' when they are granted enough carbon credits to match historic production. expensive long-term structural changes will not be made if there are cheaper sources of carbon credits which are often available from less developed countries, where they may be generated by local polluters at the expense of local communities.[44]"
history[edit],"the process began in rio de janeiro in 1992, when 160 countries agreed the un framework convention on climate change (unfccc). the necessary detail was left to be settled by the un conference of parties (cop)."
examples by country[edit],"in 2003 the new south wales (nsw) state government unilaterally established the new south wales greenhouse gas abatement scheme[75] to reduce emissions by requiring electricity generators and large consumers to purchase nsw greenhouse abatement certificates (ngacs). this has prompted the rollout of free energy-efficient compact fluorescent lightbulbs and other energy-efficiency measures, funded by the credits. this scheme has been criticised by the centre for energy and environmental markets (ceem) of the university of new south wales (unsw) because of its lack of effectiveness in reducing emissions, its lack of transparency and its lack of verification of the additionality of emission reductions.[76]"
global carbon market[edit],"a global (international) carbon market can play a significant role in stopping climate change. the paris agreement provided a legal base for its creation.[132] in the beginning of 2024 the idea made some progress, as in the bonn meeting new tools and supervisory bodies was created. one of the purposes is to address human rights issues during the implementation of the mechanism. to establish such market, capacity building measures in participating countries are needed. those measures are advancing ""with the number of designated national authorities rising to 72 on 1 march from 64 on 2 november.""[133]"
society and culture[edit],"in the united states, most polling shows large support for emissions trading (often referred to as cap-and-trade). this majority support can be seen in polls conducted by the washington post/abc news,[139] zogby international[140] and yale university.[141] according to politifact, it is a misconception that emissions trading is unpopular in the united states because of earlier polls from zogby international and rasmussen which misleadingly include ""new taxes"" in the questions (taxes are not part of emissions trading) or high energy cost estimates.[142]"
definition[edit],"a carbon offset is a way of compensating for emissions of  carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. it is a reduction, avoidance, or removal of emissions to compensate for emissions released elsewhere. it represents an emission reduction or removal of one metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent or co2e, i.e. it can also represent an equivalent amount of other greenhouse gases (ghgs).[15] carbon offsets and credits are a form of carbon pricing, along with carbon taxes and subsidies. the concepts of offsets and credits are linked. both offsets and credits can move among the various markets they are traded in.[16]"
common features[edit],common features associated with carbon offset programs are listed below in alphabetical order.
origins and general features[edit],"in 1977, major amendments to the us clean air act created one of the first tradable emission offset mechanisms. this allowed a permitted facility to increase its emissions. in return it had to pay another company to reduce its emissions of the same pollutant by a greater amount at one or more of its facilities.[28] the 1990 amendments to that same law established the acid rain trading program. this introduced the concept of a cap and trade system, where limits on a pollutant would decrease over time. it allowed companies to buy and sell offsets created by other companies that invested in emission reduction projects.[29] regulatory frameworks for the us clean water act enabled wetlands offsetting and mitigation banking in the 1990s. wetlands offsetting also set the procedural and conceptual precedent for carbon offsetting.[30] in 1997 the clean development mechanism was created as part of the kyoto protocol. this program expanded the concept of carbon emissions trading to a global scale. it focused on the major greenhouse gases that cause climate change.[31] these include carbon dioxide (co2), methane, nitrous oxide (n2o), perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.[32]"
programs and markets[edit],"there is a diverse range of sources of supply, sources of demand, and trading frameworks that drive offset and credit markets.[33] as of 2022, 68 carbon pricing programs were in place or scheduled to be created globally.[34] some of these involve carbon taxes, but many are carbon emission trading programs, or other types of market-oriented program involving carbon offsets and credits. international programs include the clean development mechanism, article 6 of the paris agreement, and corsia. national programs include ets systems such as the european union emissions trading system (eu-ets) and the california cap and trade program. eligible credits in these programs may include credits that  international or independent crediting systems have issued. there are also standards and crediting mechanisms that independent, nongovernmental entities such as verra and gold standard manage."
types of offset projects[edit],"a variety of projects can be used to reduce ghg emissions and thus to generate carbon offsets and credits. these can include land use improvement, methane capture, biomass sequestration, renewable energy, or industrial energy efficiency. they also include reducing methane, reforestation and switching fuel, for example to carbon-neutral and carbon-negative fuels.[80][81] the cdm identifies over 200 types of projects suitable for generating carbon offsets and credits.[82] an example of land use improvement is better forest management.[80][83]"
assuring quality and determining value[edit],many types of offset are difficult to verify because they are indirect. many reports by ngo or in the media have questioned the credibility of the various certification providers.[100]  prices for offsets and credits vary widely.[101] this may be a reflection of the uncertainty associated with these programs and practices.[102] these issues have recently caused many companies to become more skeptical about buying offsets or credits.[103]
effectiveness[edit],offset and credit programs have been identified as a way for countries to meet their ndc commitments and achieve the goals of the paris agreement at a lower cost.[11] they may also help close the emissions gap identified in annual unep reports.[120]
limitations and drawbacks[edit],"the use of offsets and credits faces a variety of criticisms. some argue that they promote a ""business-as-usual"" mindset, allowing companies to use carbon offsetting to avoid making larger changes to reduce carbon emissions at source.[123][124] using projects in this way is called ""greenwashing"".[125] pope francis noted in his 2015 encyclical letter laudato si' the risk that countries and sectors may use carbon credits as ""a ploy which permits maintaining [their] excessive consumption"".[126]"
introduction[edit],"pollution is a prime example of a market externality. an externality is an effect of some activity on an entity (such as a person) that is not party to a market transaction related to that activity. emissions trading is a market-based approach to address pollution. the overall goal of an emissions trading plan is to minimize the cost of meeting a set emissions target.[8]
in an emissions trading system, the government sets an overall limit on emissions, and defines permits (also called allowances), or limited authorizations to emit, up to the level of the overall limit. the government may sell the permits, but in many existing schemes, it gives permits to participants (regulated polluters) equal to each participant's baseline emissions. the baseline is determined by reference to the participant's historical emissions. to demonstrate compliance, a participant must hold permits at least equal to the quantity of pollution it actually emitted during the time period. if every participant complies, the total pollution emitted will be at most equal to the sum of individual limits.[9] because permits can be bought and sold, a participant can choose either to use its permits exactly (by reducing its own emissions); or to emit less than its permits, and perhaps sell the excess permits; or to emit more than its permits, and buy permits from other participants. in effect, the buyer pays a charge for polluting, while the seller gains a reward for having reduced emissions."
history[edit],"the efficiency of what later was to be called the ""cap-and-trade"" approach to air pollution abatement was first demonstrated in a series of micro-economic computer simulation studies between 1967 and 1970 for the national air pollution control administration (predecessor to the united states environmental protection agency's office of air and radiation) by ellison burton and william sanjour. these studies used mathematical models of several cities and their emission sources in order to compare the cost and effectiveness of various control strategies.[14][15][16][17][18] each abatement strategy was compared with the ""least-cost solution"" produced by a computer optimization program to identify the least-costly combination of source reductions in order to achieve a given abatement goal. in each case it was found that the least-cost solution was dramatically less costly than the same amount of pollution reduction produced by any conventional abatement strategy.[19] burton and later sanjour along with edward h. pechan continued improving[20] and advancing[21] these computer models at the newly created u.s. environmental protection agency.  the agency introduced the concept of computer modeling with least-cost abatement strategies (i.e., emissions trading) in its 1972 annual report to congress on the cost of clean air.[22] this led to the concept of ""cap and trade"" as a means of achieving the ""least-cost solution"" for a given level of abatement."
economics[edit],"it is possible for a country to reduce emissions using a command-and-control approach, such as regulation, direct and indirect taxes. the cost of that approach differs between countries because the marginal abatement cost curve (mac)—the cost of eliminating an additional unit of pollution—differs by country."
comparison with other methods of emission reduction[edit],"cap and trade is the textbook example of an emissions trading program. other market-based approaches include baseline-and-credit, and pollution tax. they all put a price on pollution (for example, see carbon price), and so provide an economic incentive to reduce pollution beginning with the lowest-cost opportunities. by contrast, in a command-and-control approach, a central authority designates pollution levels each facility is allowed to emit.  cap and trade essentially functions as a tax where the tax rate is variable based on the relative cost of abatement per unit, and the tax base is variable based on the amount of abatement needed.[citation needed]"
trading systems[edit],"apart from the dynamic development in carbon emission trading, other pollutants have also been targeted."
criticism[edit],"the us congressional budget office (cbo, 2009) examined the potential effects of the american clean energy and security act on us households.[81] this act relies heavily on the free allocation of permits. the bill was found to protect low-income consumers, but it was recommended that the bill be made more efficient by reducing welfare provisions for corporations, and that more resources be made available for consumer relief.  a cap-and-trade initiative in the u.s. northeast caused concerns it would be regressive and poorer households would absorb most of the new tax.[82]"
effectiveness[edit],"faure and peeters cautiously endorse the effectiveness of emissions trading in practice: ""notably for the greenhouse gas emissions problem, emissions trading seems to be very much suited to reaching the necessary reductions in a cost-effective way.""[83]"
