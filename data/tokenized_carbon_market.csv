in an emissions trading system, the government sets an overall limit on emissions, and defines permits (also called allowances), or limited authorizations to emit, up to the level of the overall limit. the government may sell the permits, but in many existing schemes, it gives permits to participants (regulated polluters) equal to each participant's baseline emissions. the baseline is determined by reference to the participant's historical emissions. to demonstrate compliance, a participant must hold permits at least equal to the quantity of pollution it actually emitted during the time period. if every participant complies, the total pollution emitted will be at most equal to the sum of individual limits.[9] because permits can be bought and sold, a participant can choose either to use its permits exactly (by reducing its own emissions); or to emit less than its permits, and perhaps sell the excess permits; or to emit more than its permits, and buy permits from other participants. in effect, the buyer pays a charge for polluting, while the seller gains a reward for having reduced emissions.
